In the simulation a liquid droplet is placed on a model surface and constant temperature, rigid body molecular dynamics is carried out while the model surface is kept fixed. A generally defined microscopic contact angle between a liquid droplet and a solid surface is quantitatively calculated from the volume of the droplet and the interfacial area between the droplet and the surface. The simulation results agree with the trend in experimental data for both water and methylene iodide. The shape of the droplets on the surface is analyzed and no obvious anisotropy of the droplets is seen in the surface plane, even though the crystal surfaces are highly oriented. The surface free energies of the model polymer surfaces are estimated from their contact angles with the two different liquid droplets.},

	abstract = {Resin/reinforcement wetting is a key parameter in the manufacturing of carbon nanotube ({CNT})-based composite materials. Determining the contact angle between combinations of liquid resin and reinforcement surfaces is a common method for quantifying wettability. As experimental measurement of contact angle can be difﬁcult when screening multiple high-performance resins with {CNT} materials such as {CNT} bundles or yarns, computational approaches are necessary to facilitate {CNT} composite material design. A molecular dynamics simulation method is developed to predict the contact angle of high-performance polymer resins on {CNT} surfaces dominated by aromatic carbon, aliphatic carbon, or a mixture thereof (amorphous carbon). Several resin systems are simulated and compared. The results indicate that the monomer chain length, chemical groups on the monomer, and simulation temperature have a signiﬁcant impact on the predicted contact angle values on the {CNT} surface. Difunctional epoxy and cyanate ester resins show the overall highest levels of wettability, regardless of the aromatic/aliphatic nature of the {CNT} material surface. Tetrafunctional epoxy demonstrates excellent wettability on aliphatic-dominated surfaces at elevated temperatures. Bismaleimide and benzoxazine resins show intermediate levels of wetting, while typical molecular weights of polyether ether ketone demonstrate poor wetting on the {CNT} surfaces.},
